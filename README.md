# run_analysis.R

This script reads data from the `raw_data` folder and generates a tidy data set, which calculates the mean value of the sensor data for each subject+activity combination.

It also generates a `clean_data` file that contains a subset of the raw data, which includes only the raw data related to averages and standard deviations.
